Android D2Go
============

`D2Go <https://github.com/pytorch/android-demo-app/tree/master/D2Go>`__
demonstrates a Python script that creates the much lighter and much
faster Facebook `D2Go <https://github.com/facebookresearch/d2go>`__
model that is powered by PyTorch 1.8, torchvision 0.9, and Detectron2
with built-in SOTA networks for mobile, and an Android app that uses it
to detect objects from pictures in your photos, taken with camera, or
with live camera. This demo app also shows how to use the native
pre-built torchvision-ops library.
