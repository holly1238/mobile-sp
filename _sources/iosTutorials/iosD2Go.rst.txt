iOS D2Go
========

`D2Go <https://github.com/pytorch/ios-demo-app/tree/master/D2Go>`__
demonstrates a Python script that creates the much lighter and much
faster Facebook `D2Go <https://github.com/facebookresearch/d2go>`__
model that is powered by PyTorch 1.8, torchvision 0.9, and Detectron2
with built-in SOTA networks for mobile - the D2Go model is very small (only 2.15MB) and runs very fast on iOS. 
This D2Go iOS demo app shows how to prepare and use the D2Go model on iOS with the newly released LibTorchvision Cocoapods.
