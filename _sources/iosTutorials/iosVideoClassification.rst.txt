iOS Video Classification
========================

`TorchVideo <https://github.com/pytorch/ios-demo-app/tree/master/TorchVideo>`__
demonstrates how to use a pre-trained video classification model,
available at the newly released
`PyTorchVideo <https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorchvideo>`__, on
iOS to see video classification results, updated per second while the
video plays, on tested videos, videos from the Photos library, or even
real-time videos.
